# circular_linklist_c
This is a C program that implements a circular linked list with the following operations:

1. Create a circular linked list
2. Display the list
3. Insert a node at the end
4. Insert a node after a given node
5. Delete the first node
6. Exit

The program uses a struct node to represent a node in the list, with an int data field and a next pointer. It uses a global pointer start to keep track of the starting node of the list.

The program presents a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the list. Each operation is implemented in a separate function:

- create_ll: Creates a new circular linked list by repeatedly asking for values until -1 is entered.
- display: Prints the values in the list.
- insert_end: Inserts a new node at the end of the list.
- insert_after: Inserts a new node after a given node.
- delete_first: Deletes the first node in the list.

Note that this program has some issues, such as:

- Memory leaks: The program does not free the memory allocated for nodes when they are deleted.
- Lack of error handling: The program does not check for errors when allocating memory or reading input.
- Inconsistent comments: Some comments are outdated or incorrect.

This program can be enhanced by adding more features, such as:

- Inserting nodes at specific positions
- Deleting nodes by value
- Reversing the list
- Sorting the list

Overall, this program demonstrates basic circular linked list operations in C.
